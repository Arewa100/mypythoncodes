# 1: write a function called get_sortedNumbers
# 2: pass in three parameter called num_one, num_two, num_three
# 3: inside the function, create a variable called largest, small and smallest 
# 4: compare the num_one with num_two, if num_one, compare anyone that is greater between them with num_ three
# 5: if result from step 3 equal to not zero, return "it is an odd integer"
# 6: test the function by prompting user for input
