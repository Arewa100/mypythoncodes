#pseudo code
# 1: create a variable called counter and assign a value of 1000 to it.
# 2: write a iteration statement 
# 3: give it a condition starting from counter and ending in 3000 
# 4: create a variable amd assign it to the modulo of counter and 2
# 5: write a condition statement using if statement
# 6: if the condition in number 4 is equal to zero, print the counter value




counter = 1000

while counter < 3000:
	result = (counter % 2)            001
	if result == 0:
		fourthnumber = counter % 10
		firstdivision = counter // 10  
		thirdnumber = firstdivision % 10  
		seconddivision = firstdivision // 10    
		secondnumber = seconddivision % 10     
		firstnumber = seconddivision // 10   

		print(evennumber)	
	
	counter = counter + 1
